### Tic-tac-toe tech test
by Ben Vaughan-Jones


The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

- There are two players in the game (X and O)
- Players take turns until the game is over
- A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
- A turn ends when a player claims a field
- A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
- A game is over if a player wins
- A game is over when all fields are taken
- Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

Thoughts
- Project is outstanding
- Approaching the task with a very strong TDD design
- There are currently 3 classes but strongly considering adding a Rulebook class to completely seperate the rules of the game so they are referred to and not implemented in the Game class.
